# Get Started

Welcome to the Next.js Boilerplate Kit! This project is a starting point for building modern web applications using Next.js 14 with various integrations and features like built-in routing, authentication, UI components, themes, multi-language support, and more.

## Quick Start from template

### Deploy to Vercel

If you prefer a quick and hassle-free way to get started with the Next.js Boilerplate Kit, simply click on the following Deploy Button. It will set up a new Vercel project using the template and deploy it automatically. You can then access and customize your project on Vercel's platform without any additional setup required.

### Fork SaasterKit

Alternatively, if you prefer to have more control over the setup process, you can manually fork the [template repository](https://github.com/leandroercoli/SaasterKit.git) and follow the instructions below.

## Getting Started

To begin using this boilerplate, follow these steps:

### 1. Clone the Repository

First, clone the repository to your local machine by running the following command:

```bash
git clone git@github.com:leandroercoli/SaasterKit.git
```

### 2. Set up Environment Variables

Navigate to the root directory of the project and create a new file named `.env.local`. You can use the provided `.env.example` file as a reference for setting up your environment variables. Make sure to fill in the required values for authentication, database configuration, email settings, and other services.

```bash
cp .env.example .env.local
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

Next, install the project dependencies by running:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
```

### 4. Run the Development Server

Start the development server to see the project in action:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
```

Opena a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000` to view the application.

You are now ready to start customizing the boilerplate to fit your project requirements. Happy coding!
