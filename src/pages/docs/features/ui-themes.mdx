# UI & Themes

This project incorporates Tailwind CSS for styling and the Shadcn components library for UI elements, providing a streamlined approach to designing user interfaces. You can customize the theme by modifying the `tailwind.config.js` file and the `globals.css` file. Additionally, there is a fully functional example showcasing various UI components under `app/dashboard`.

## UI Components

### Shadcn Components Library

The `shadcn` components library provides a collection of sleek UI components that can be easily integrated into your project. You can find a collection of components from `shadcn` under `/libs/ui`.

### Recharts for Data Visualization

The project utilizes the `recharts` library for displaying sleek and interactive charts. You can create visually appealing data visualizations and enhance the presentation of data within your application. You can find some examples on the Dashboard app.

## Themes

### Theme Customization

To customize the theme in Tailwind CSS, modify the `tailwind.config.js` file. Tailwind CSS allows you to define custom colors, typography settings, spacing utilities, and more to tailor the design to your project's requirements.

### Global Styles

The `globals.css` file contains global styles that apply to the entire project. You can use this file to define global styles, custom classes, or override default styles to maintain consistency across the application.

### Next-Themes for Theme Management

'Next-Themes' is used to handle persistent light and dark themes in the application. This library provides utilities, like the `DarkModeToggle` button, for managing theme preferences and ensuring a seamless transition between light and dark theme modes.

        marginTop: '2em',
        marginBottom: '2em',
        borderRadius: '8px',
        border: '2px solid rgba(0,0,0,0.1)',
    }}
/>

### Seamless Adaptation to Different Devices

The combination of Tailwind CSS and Shadcn components follows a mobile-first approach, where the design and layout are initially optimized for mobile devices. As the screen size increases, the design elements scale and adjust automatically to provide a user-friendly experience on larger screens.
