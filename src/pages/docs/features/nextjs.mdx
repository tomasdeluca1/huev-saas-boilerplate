# Next.js 14

This project is built using Next.js 14 with app router, designed to provide a robust foundation for developing modern web applications. Next.js is a popular React framework that offers a variety of features and optimizations, making it a great choice for building scalable and performant web applications.

### Why Next.js 14 with App Router?

Next.js 14 with app router offers a range of benefits for building Software as a Service (SaaS) applications: 

1. **Improved Performance**: Next.js 14 comes with performance optimizations such as faster startup times, improved build speeds, and reduced bundle sizes. The app router in Next.js ensures efficient routing by automatically prefetching linked pages, leading to a smoother user experience and better loading times for SaaS applications.

2. **Enhanced Dynamic Routing**: With the app router in Next.js, developers can easily define dynamic routes and nested routes, making it easier to create complex page structures for SaaS applications. The built-in support for dynamic routing simplifies the implementation of user-specific pages, dashboards, and content, enhancing the flexibility and scalability of the application.

3. **Server-side Rendering (SSR)**: Next.js 14 with app router supports server-side rendering out of the box, enabling SaaS applications to deliver SEO-friendly and optimized content to users. SSR improves the initial page load speed and ensures that search engines can crawl and index the application effectively, making it a valuable feature for SaaS products aiming to reach a wider audience.
