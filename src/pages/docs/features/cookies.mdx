# Handling Cookies with `cookies-next`

We leverage the `cookies-next` library to manage cookies effectively within a Next.js application, both in client and server components. The `cookies-next` library, compatible with Next.js 13 and above, simplifies the process of getting, setting, and removing cookies.

## Usage

The library can be utilized in various contexts across the project. Find the entire documentation [here](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cookies-next).

### Client Components

```
'use client'
import { getCookies, setCookie, deleteCookie, getCookie } from 'cookies-next';

getCookies();
getCookie('key');
setCookie('key', 'value');
deleteCookie('key');
```

### Server Components

```
import { setCookie, getCookie, getCookies, deleteCookie, hasCookie } from 'cookies-next';
import { cookies } from 'next/headers';

getCookie('test1', { cookies });
getCookies({ cookies });
hasCookie('test1', { cookies });
```

## Functional Example: Currency Selection

A functional example for selecting and persisting the currency selection is available under the `/libs/cookies/currency` folder in the project. This example showcases the usage of `cookies-next` for managing currency preferences on both the client and server sides, providing a comprehensive demonstration of how to effectively handle and persist user selections across different application layers.
