# Using Nextra for MDX documentation support

Our kit incorporates Nextra, a lightweight, customizable Markdown/MDX renderer for Next.js. It allows you to transform your regular Markdown or MDX files into fully functional React components and pages. The beauty of Nextra lies in its simplicity and plug-and-play nature, integrating effortlessly with the file-based routing of Next.js.

## Why `Nextra`?

-   **MDX Support**: Write JSX within your markdown content, giving you the capability to use React components directly in your documentation or blog posts.
-   **Theme Customization**: It comes with built-in themes that are fully customizable to match your branding needs.
-   **File-based Routing**: Nextra automatically generates routes based on your file structure in the `pages` directory, making it easy to manage your site structure.

## Using `Nextra`

Out kit already includes preconfigured code for MDX documentation support with the Docs Theme. You can customize it by updating the `theme.config.jsx` file.

We have included the documentation for this kit under `src/pages` directory, so you can use it as a starting point and update it to fit your needs.
