# Landing Page Example

The landing page example included in this project serves as a model for a Software as a Service (SaaS) page, showcasing a modern design that can be customized or extended using Shadcn components. You can leverage this landing page template as a foundation for your SaaS application, with the flexibility to personalize the layout, content, and styling to align with your brand identity and messaging.

You can refer to the example in `/app/[locale]/page.tsx` to understand how to integrate and utilize the available components effectively in constructing a compelling landing page.

## Building Blocks

The project provides building blocks for constructing a landing page, accessible under the `@/libs/components/landing-page` folder.

The components are designed with a modular approach, allowing you to mix and match different elements to create a coherent layout for the landing page.
